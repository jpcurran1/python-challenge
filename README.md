First Python Homework 
FOr this homework there were two major assingments PyBank and PyPoll
In the files "main.py" is the code I used to get the outcome for PyBank and "main2.py" is the file I used to get the outcome for PyPoll. 
I struggled to get the output into the txt file. I tried to use the command with open(file_to_output, "w") as txt file:
  txt_file.write(output) with the "file" being my file path. I was not successful so took screenshots of my terminal outputs hoping this would at least count for something. Those screenshots can be found in the "terminal" results document.
